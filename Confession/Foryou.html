            I’ve been meaning to say this for a while and kept thinking when or where should I tell you, but I never
            really knew the right moment. So I thought I’d say it in my own way using the things I love to do and making
            this for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like you. Not just because of the small things, but because of how you make me feel.
            The way you talk when we're debating on stupid things and joke around a lot,
            the way you smile that makes my heart melt and happy, and the way you unknowingly make ordinary moments feel
            lighter and memorable every time.
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s no pressure in this, and no expectations.
            I just wanted you to know how I feel about you, honestly telling what you mean to me and sincerely telling
            the truth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whatever you feel is okay.
            I’m just thankful I got to tell you the truth.
        </p>
