        <p>
            I’ve been meaning to say this for a while and kept thinking when or where should I tell you, but I never
            really knew the right moment. So I thought I’d say it in my own way, through something I enjoy and making
            this for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like you. Not just because of the small things, but because of how you make me feel.
            The way you talk when we're argued and laughed on silly things,
            the way you smile that makes my heart melt and happy, and the way you unknowingly make ordinary moments feel
            lighter and memorable every time.
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s no pressure in this, and no expectations.
            I just wanted you to know how I feel about you, honestly telling what you mean to me and sincerely telling
            the truth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whatever you feelings may be, that's completely okay.
            I’m just grateful to have been able to tell you the truth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for being who you are, for the laughters we shared, small moments we cherished, and the joy you bring just by
            being around. I treasure every memories we share and hope this gives a glimpse of how much I truly apprieciate you.
        </p>
